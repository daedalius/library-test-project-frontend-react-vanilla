# Just another seed for mine and your React projects ü§ó

## What is in the box? üì¶

- Not a Solidüêç or a üíéüêï
- React 17
- Typescript
- Webpack 5
- Storybook 6
- Cypress 7
- Jest 27
- React Testing Library

‚úÖ Storybook and Cypress run on the Webpack config provided.

## Misc and tweaks

- Some Prettier config
- Some ESLint config
- Some image loading
- Some Storybook helper functions to easily describe Stories in CSF-format
- Changed Storybook Docs global render (you may remove "docs" section from "parameters" in ./storybook/preview.js file)
- Two tsconfigs to avoid [Cypress/Jest typings collision](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-and-jest-typescript-example)
