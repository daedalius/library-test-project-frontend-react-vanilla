# Just another seed for mine and your React projects ü§ó

## What is in the box? üì¶

- Not a Solid üêç
- React 17
- TypeScript
- Webpack 5
- Storybook 6
- Cypress 9
- Jest 27
- React Testing Library
- Collecting total code-coverage from:
  - Cypress e2e test runs
  - Cypress component test runs
  - Jest test runs

‚úÖ Storybook and Cypress run on the Webpack config provided.

## Misc and tweaks

- Some Prettier config
- Some ESLint config
- Some image loading
- Some SVG loading
- Some Storybook helper functions to easily describe Stories in CSF-format
- Changed Storybook Docs global render (you may remove "docs" section from "parameters" in ./storybook/preview.js file)
- Two tsconfigs to avoid [Cypress/Jest typings collision](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-and-jest-typescript-example)
- üê≥ Some Docker and Docker Compose configs

## Code coverage

üìä To see total code coverage report run one by one:

- `npm run start:instrumented`
- `npm run test:e2e:ci` or `npm run test:e2e:browser`
- `npm run test:components:ci` or `npm run test:components:browser`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run report-total-coverage`
  The report is waiting for you in `/coverage/total/lcov-report/index.html`.
